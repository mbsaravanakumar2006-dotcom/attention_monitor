# 📘 Classroom Attention Monitor using AI

An AI-based smart classroom system that detects and analyzes the attention levels of students in real time using computer vision and machine learning.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Classroom Attention Monitor is designed to observe student behavior in a classroom environment and classify their attention states such as Listening, Distracted, Sleeping, or Inactive. The system uniquely identifies each student and records behavioral changes using an event-based approach to minimize storage.

## 🚀 Key Features

* Real-time multi-student monitoring
* Face recognition-based student identification
* Body posture and head orientation analysis
* Eye-gaze and blink detection
* Event-based logging (stores only behavioral changes)
* Individual student attention analytics
* Overall classroom engagement visualization
* Admin-secured dashboard access
